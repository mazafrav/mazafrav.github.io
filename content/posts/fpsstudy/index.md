## Level blocking for a FPS Horror game.



This level consists of three stages and it takes place in a building filled with your favorite generic zombies. The goal is to reach the parking lot situated at the bottom of the building.


The first part is the rooftop of the building where the player receives information about the context of the scene and his goal.

The second part is the interior of the building, there are a couple of npcs that give hints to the player, along with keys, locked doors and pickups needed to move forward.

Lastly, the final showdown occurs in the parking lot, where the player will face a swarm of "zombies" before reaching the goal.

The level is designed so the player feels the tension of not knowing what to expect around the corner while looking for a way out. The rooms are dark and the light is used to highlight the points of interest.

Shadows are used to anticipate the presence of an enemy and generate tension.

Resources are very limited and scattered around so the player has to thoroughly search every corner to get the necessary items to survive the encounters.
