# The Game
## Local Asymmetrical Co-op Game


{{< split 6 6>}}

<br>
<br>
An <strong>adventure game</strong> featuring both <strong>combat and puzzles</strong> for two players, where you control two mages working together to fight their way through the newly-formed Minion Union.


<br>Designed to be <strong>accessible</strong> for both experienced and casual players, the game blends humor, satire, and chaos. Each character has a unique combat style and abilities—one focuses on melee combat and brute force, while the other specializes in ranged combat and strategic play.

## Development

{{< split 5 2 5>}}

<br>The game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 by a team of 18, including designers, programmers, artists, and producers.

I'm serving as the lead designer, managing the design team and coordinating with other departments. While I work as a generalist designer, my primary focus is on technical design, level design, and camera-control-character systems.

<em>Game development after demo publication is under NDA.</em>

## Project Highlights

### Camera


{{< split 7 5>}}

<br>The game has an isometric view camera with fixed angle, so Camera Design was the first challenge I faced when the first level prototypes where set. 

One of the key dynamics I wanted to enforce was for the players to remain together and cooperate. The first consideration was a dynamic split camera, but having a clear line of sight of your teammate was very important so it was scrapped.

With that in mind, I desgined a dynamic gravity point system along with player confinement inside the screen. This system gives the players significant freedom of movement while also restricting the distance between them and the points of interest with flexibility.
