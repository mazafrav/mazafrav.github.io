# The Game
## Local Asymmetrical Co-op Game


{{< split 6 6>}}

<br>
<br>
An <strong>adventure game</strong> featuring both <strong>combat and puzzles</strong> for two players, where you control two mages working together to fight their way through the newly-formed Minion Union.


<br>Designed to be <strong>accessible</strong> for both experienced and casual players, the game blends humor, satire, and chaos. Each character has a unique combat style and abilities—one focuses on melee combat and brute force, while the other specializes in ranged combat and strategic play.

## Development

{{< split 5 1 6>}}

<br>
The game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 by a team of 18, including designers, programmers, artists, and producers.

I'm serving as the lead designer, managing the design team and coordinating with other departments. While I work as a generalist designer, my primary focus is on technical design, level design, and camera-control-character systems.
