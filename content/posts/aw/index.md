## Local Asymmetrical Co-op Game

An adventure game featuring both combat and puzzles for two players, where you control two mages working together to fight their way through the newly-formed Minion Union.

Designed to be accessible for both experienced and casual players, the game blends humor, satire, and chaos. Each character has a unique combat style and abilities—one focuses on melee combat and brute force, while the other specializes in ranged combat and strategic play.

## Development

The game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 by a team of 18, including designers, programmers, artists, and producers.

I'm serving as the lead designer, overseeing the design team and coordinating with other departments. While I work as a generalist designer, my primary focus is on technical design, level design, and camera-control-character systems.

My work in this project includes:

* Mechanics design

* Enemy AI design.

* Boss design and implementation.

* Map elements and events implementation.

* Playstesting analysis

* Camera system design and implementation

* Documentation.

* VFX and shader implementation.
