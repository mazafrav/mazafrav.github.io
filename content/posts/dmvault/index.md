### About

## Dryad Encounter

{{< vs 2>}}

This battle encounter was created for a group of friends new to TTRPGs. 
<br><br>Initially designed as a friendly encounter, it was reworked into a tutorial to teach the importance of cover and line of sight. 
<br><br>The group consists mostly of ranged spellcasters, so I set up a map with trees as cover and ranged enemies. The enemy team is led by an angry dryad who teleports between trees, forcing the players to search for her while hiding. 
<br><br>Four awakened shrubs ambush once the dryad spots the players. The dryad attacks those not using cover, encouraging repositioning. 
<br><br>This also serves as an introduction to a later boss fight with a teleporting witch.
