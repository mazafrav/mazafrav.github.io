  paper:
    summary: This paper addresses the design and implementation of a path following controlling system for a drone which relies on 3D localization by visual markers. It has been designed only for indoor flights. Special attention is paid to accuracy of the position estimation algorithm, robustness of the path following controller and real time operation. The path following system is composed of two components, one responsible of the image analysis and 3D pose estimation and another responsible of the drone navigation. It has been experimentally validated both in Gazebo simulator and in a real drone.
